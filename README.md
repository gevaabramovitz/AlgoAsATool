1. To train needs to run the predictor engine with the path to the train data "DATA_PATH" and determine the precision metric flag "PRE_FLAG" (determine to prioritize accuracy - false or TPR- true)  
2. To predict - run the Predictor_gui (if no pickles files are saved, you must train before asking for prediction)
